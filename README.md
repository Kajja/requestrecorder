kajja/requestrecorder
=====================

This is a small PHP module to save HTTP request information in a database and to display the saved HTTP request information.

Currently, the only information that is saved are:
* The requested URI
* The request method
* Datetime for the request
* Session id, to be able to link a request to a session

The module also includes a presentation part that formats the HTTP-request records in the database to HTML, for simple integration into a web project.
